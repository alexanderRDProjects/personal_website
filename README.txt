this is a general file listing the current bugs or the way the program will move forward to enchance the users expereince add neew features and generaly make the website better

current issues

Backend:

The database needs to be normalised to third normal form and is not performing at full potentail here are some of the issues
	the time of comment is not recorded in the database. this will be important to implement as it will show if comments have been asked ages ago or if a comment is jsut been posted
	the database still needs the blog feature to be implemented this will require a seperate table within the database that will allow blog posts to be records
	each blog will need a id and have comment features enabled

Using PHP include() to reduce repeated code. this will allows each each script to call a central script and store parameter in a text file (maybe encrypted) so any changes to the code will apply to every page that requires that processing this will be a major restructure of the website and may result in down time

Front end:

[partly complete]the comment system looks terrible. [complete]complete reworked needed. [complete]in addition the comments does not support the google avatar even though backend supports it.
the blog system should be unique the rest of the pages at the moment it just looks like a project page of a project called blog. pessimisun over.

centralizing the nagivation bar to adapt the larger google signin button would be a nice.

making the background and static would help the website be more professional
